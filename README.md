# AI-Based-SHM-Framework
Condition-aware AI framework for automated structural health monitoring

This repository provides the executable releases of a three-module Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) framework developed as part of an advanced research program on vibration-based damage detection and localization.

The toolkit includes:

Module 1: Automated Modal Identification (SSI-Cov / FSDD)

Module 2: Condition-Aware Anomaly Detection using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)

Module 3: Signal-Domain Verification and Damage Localization (SSA + OC-SVM)

All modules are provided as stand-alone Windows executables, requiring no Python installation or dependencies.
Each tool includes representative sample datasets to ensure reproducibility of the results reported in the corresponding scientific study.
